# DiscordBot
This Discord bot provides insights into GitHub repositories by answering user queries directly within Discord. It uses the GitHub API to fetch repository information, the OpenAI API for natural language understanding and response generation, and integrates semantic search to find relevant files within a GitHub repository.
